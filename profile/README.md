:dart: [CHEN](http://cpathology.com) strives to systematically characterize tumor cells and their microenvironment, for an in-depth understanding of neoplasm evolution from preneoplastic lesions, to localized tumor, and ultimately to metastatic cancer as well as heterogeneities among the same tumor types and stages, by developing innovative computational tools to interrogate large-scale pathology sides, and their integration with clinicodemographics, radiomics, multi-omics, etc.
