:dart: [CHEN](http://cpathology.com) strives to systematically characterize the tumor immune microenvironment, for an in-depth understanding of neoplasm evolution from preneoplastic lesions, to localized, and ultimately metastatic tumors, as well as heterogeneities among tumors of the same type and stage, by developing innovative computational frameworks to interrogate large-scale pathology slides, and their integration with clinicodemographic profiles, multi-omics, etc.
