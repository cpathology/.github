:dart: [CHEN](http://cpathology.com) strives to systematically characterize the tumor immune microenvironment, for an in-depth understanding of tumor heterogeneities and the neoplasm evolution from preneoplastic lesions, to localized and ultimately metastatic tumors, by developing innovative computational frameworks to interrogate large-scale pathology slides, and their integration with clinicodemographic profiles, multi-omics, etc.
